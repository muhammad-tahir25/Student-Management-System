# Student-Management-System
This Student Management System (SMS) is a simple Bash-based project designed to manage student records through the command line. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete student information using a menu-driven interface. Developed as part of a university course, the project showcases basic file handling and scripting concepts in Linux.
